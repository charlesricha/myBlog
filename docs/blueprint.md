## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#673AB7) to serve as the main color for buttons and interactive elements.
- Background color: Dark gray (#212121) for a modern, dark theme, creating a high contrast environment that is easy on the eyes.
- Accent color: Light purple (#D0B4FF), an analogous hue to the primary, with higher brightness and saturation to create a good contrast for highlights and hover states.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, for both headlines and body text, lending a modern and neutral look.
- GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) to introduce subtle animations across the site. This includes fade-in effects, smooth scrolling, and animated transitions.
- Mobile-responsive design achieved with Tailwind CSS to ensure the blog is accessible and visually appealing on all devices, from desktops to smartphones.
